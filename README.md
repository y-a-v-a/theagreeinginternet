# The Agreeing Internet

***The Agreeing Internet*** is a digital art project that presents an optimistic counterpoint to negativity on the web. The website features a gently animated frame that "agrees" with the content it displays, creating a playful and positive browsing experience.

## About

This project was created in 2009 by [ax710](http://www.ax710.org/) and [y-a-v-a.org](http://www.y-a-v-a.org/) as a response to and inspiration from [Constant Dullaart](http://www.constantdullaart.com/)'s work [The Disagreeing Internet](http://www.thedisagreeinginternet.com/).

While Dullaart's original work expressed disagreement through visual disruption, The Agreeing Internet inverts this concept by creating a gentle, affirming animation that "nods" in agreement with the displayed content.

## Technical Details

- Modern HTML5 implementation
- Responsive design with viewport meta tag
- JavaScript animation creating the "agreeing" effect
- Clean, minimal codebase
